# The Project 
 
In this project we aim to develop a web application where users add information about their company and data points about a specific worker to assess the cost of losing that specific employee. Because this is public-facing, we really want a well-designed front end that matches our brand at openavenuesfoundation.org. We want the web application to capture lead information (i.e. company names, emails, contact person) and get it into a comma-delimited text format. We also want visitors to be able to download a PDF report of costs for losing their foreign-born employee. If possible, we’d love to be able to store the data entered on the company characteristics and foreign-born employees in order to create data visualizations of where the employee falls across the estimates generated, by company industry, size or type of employee.

# Considerations 

A variety of factors contribute to foregone cost of losing an employee; these include:
- loss of productivity, 
- recruitment fees, 
- lower staff morale, 
- and institutional loss. 

We have created an excel worksheet that has these values and calculations for their amounts. We will provide students this excel with values and formulas. We can provide students with images of our logo and the color scheme of our branding with the html color codes for our branding.

# Project Deliverables

Application which enables the customized cost calculation of losing a foreign-born employee. We’d like the application to store the calculations for us to use later and provide a PDF export option.  
 
# Required Goals
- Store lead generation information 
- Calculate and show cost of losing a foreign-born employee 
- PDF export of cost calculation 
 
# Optional / Nice-to-have Goals 
- Public-facing front end that matches our brand  
- Store information of costs from users 
- Data visualizations of the average cost of losing a foreign-born employee by company characteristics (e.g. size, industry, location) and foreign-born employee characteristics (field, title).
